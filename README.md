## 1. Information We Do Not Collect
Our App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information (such as name, email, phone number, or device ID) to our servers or any third party. We do not use any third‐party SDKs, analytics, ads, or tracking services that collect user data.

## 2. Local Data Storage (On Your Device)
When you use the App:
* You may enter a name and upload a profile image.
* This information is **stored only in the local storage** of your mobile device (e.g., SharedPreferences, local files, or app cache).
* It is **not** sent to our servers or any external service.
* If you uninstall the App, this local data is automatically removed from your device.

## 3. Server Data (Feed Images)
* The App fetches images from our server to display in the feed.
* These images are not linked to your personal information.
* We do not log or store which user requested which image.
* All communication between the App and our server uses **HTTPS encryption**.
